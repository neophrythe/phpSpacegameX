-- Combat System Schema
-- This file is intended to supplement schema.sql if needed,
-- but core tables like battle_reports, espionage_reports, and player_notifications
-- are already defined in schema.sql.
-- The battle_points column is also already in the players table in schema.sql.

-- If specific combat-related alterations or *new* tables are needed, they can be added here.
-- For now, this file will be mostly empty to avoid re-declaration errors.

-- Example of how you might add a NEW combat-specific table if one was needed:
-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS combat_simulations (
--     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
--     simulation_data TEXT,
--     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
--     PRIMARY KEY (id)
-- ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- No operations needed here for now as schema.sql covers these.
