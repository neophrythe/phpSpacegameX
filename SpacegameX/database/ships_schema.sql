-- Ship Types and Fleet Management Schema for SpacegameX
-- This file is intended to supplement schema.sql if needed.
-- Core tables like static_ship_types, player_ships, fleets, and fleet_ships
-- are already defined in schema.sql.

-- If specific ship or fleet-related alterations or *new* tables are needed,
-- they can be added here.
-- For now, this file will be mostly empty to avoid re-declaration errors.

-- Example of how you might add a NEW ship-specific table if one was needed:
-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ship_upgrades (
--     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
--     ship_type_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
--     upgrade_name VARCHAR(100),
--     PRIMARY KEY (id),
--     CONSTRAINT fk_su_ship_type_id FOREIGN KEY (ship_type_id) REFERENCES static_ship_types (id)
-- ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- No operations needed here for now as schema.sql covers these.
